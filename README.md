## Objectives

- You have received a working example so please do not upgrade any packages unless you really have to. `I would have add`**prop-types**` because of warning, but I'll skip as it is not really critical. But I'll add testing tool dev dependency`
- Please check for small things like syntax errors, since details matter.
- Please deliver something that works, non working project is an automatic disqualification
